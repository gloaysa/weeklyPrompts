Project:   Beaver Browser

Prompt
	You are an aspiring naturalist tracking the behavior of local Urban Beavers.
	(this is strongly influenced by the Practical Javascript final project, use it as a reference)  

Your project will contain these items:
	BEAVERS.CSS:  a file to make the html pretty
	
	BEAVERS.HTML:  the site people see and use
	
	MODEL.JS:  all functionality connected to storing, accessing, modifying beavers
	
	VIEW.JS:  all funcitonality connected to making beavers visible (the DOM)
	
	CONTROLLER.JS:  manipulates BEAVERSLIST and BEAVERVIEWER.  all buttons call a method in CONTROLLER
		
Some User Stories:
	- You see Patty at the liquor store.  so you open your phone, click 'spot Patty', and enter 'liquor store' in the text field.  now her info includes the liquor store.
	- There's a new beaver on the metro today.  You hand him your phone and ask him to register himself.  He enters his name, age, sex, and 'line 5' into the text blanks.  now you've got another beaver profile on the home page.
	- Patty gets sick of you writting down what she does every day and threatens to call the police.  you click 'untrack Patty' and now all you can see is her name and a big red 'X' next to it.
	
Challenges: 
	- (extra challengy) refactor your project to use classes instead of objects
